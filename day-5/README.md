## What is not AIOPS ? 
```
Ans. 
- Use GENAI to automate K8s workflows
- Use GenAI to generate Dockerfile, ShellScripts , CI/CD pipelines
- They are called AI Assisted DevOps and not AIOps
- AIOps is not AI Assisted DevOps
- AI Assisted Devops is using GenAI To enhance DevOps practices
```

## What is AIOps 

```
- Use AI for IT Operations for PREDICTIVE approach. 

- Observability -
      - Logs, Metrics, Traces - are 3 important parameters for Observability
      - Monitoring Metricses --> PageDuty --> Notification over Slackk, Email, Calls --> REACTIVE Approach

- AIOps - is used to predict the notification before it actually happens
        - AIOps is PREDICTIVE approach instead of REACTIVE approach.

- AIOps uses Traditional AI better, rather than GenAI.
- Historical data feed to Traditional AI Model to make them learn better
- Traditional AI after learning historical data, can Predict the patterns 
```

## How GenAI is getting integrated with Traditional AI in Observability Solutions ?
```
- Traditional AI predict the situtation
- Gen AI puts an AI Agent
- Traditional AI send the notification to Gen AI Agent
- AI Agent will perform a task to mitigate the situtation or Reacts 
- AIOps are not free for Observability Solutions
- Organizations train their models and use them for Observability

        - Davis Copilot
        - AIOps requires traditinal AI dashboards data (historical data)
        - perform Anamoly Detection 


- https://www.site24x7.com/app/demo#/home/monitors
        - Zia Anomaly Dashboard
        - Requiers Historical Data
        - Uses AI Ops to mitigate the situation
        - perform Anamoly Detection

  - Then Deploy AI Agent to perform Tasks
